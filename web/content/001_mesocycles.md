## Fragments

I don't think that organizing time into blocks is a particularly novel
innovation. Instead, the magic lies in what time blocks we choose, and how we
frame them in the narratives we tell ourselves.

Anyone who knows me can tell you that I always have some side project in the
works, and some who know me better might tell you how seldom those projects go
anywhere. I love making things, but buildng them takes a long time, and there
are more interesting projects than I could work on in a lifetime.
