## Outline

- Problem: side projects stack up
  - everything becomes a slog
  - attention wanders
  - demoralized
  - trying to fit every little project into limited spare time
  - nothing ever makes progress
- Intervention: for a year, can only work on 1-month projects
  - can be a smaller piece of something larger
  - but NO commitment to continue after a month
- Sports Theory:
  - In sports training we have microcycle -> mesocycle -> macrocycle
  -
- Results:
  - mental health,
  - multiple gamejam games and software prototypes,
  - ran a gamejam
  - started working out regularly
  - started learning to draw
  - what works
    - focused projects where I get to control the scoping
    - small games
    - libraries / applications
    - furniture
  - what doesn't work
    - online courses / learning
      - you don't control the scope - can't commit to finishing
      - still sort of works if you use the month to focus on the thing, and have
        a plan to complete it over the long term
      - BE CAREFUL

## Fragments

I don't think that organizing time into blocks is a particularly novel
innovation. Nonetheless, the concept of mesocycles saved my bacon so completely
in 2024 that this blog is its namesake.

Anyone who knows me can tell you that I always have some side project in the
works, and some who know me better might tell you how seldom those projects go
anywhere. I love making things, but buildng them takes a long time, and there
are more interesting projects than I could work on in a lifetime.
