Since my career has been in machine learning (now AI), and given the current
state of discourse and hype, I feel it neccessary to state the following:

1. Machine Learning, or AI, is a method of statistical method of computation
   that is in no way equivalent to human thought.
2. There is a lot of snake oil, but also a lot of potential in the field.
3. As with all innovation under capitalism, this technology ultimately serves
   the owning and ruling classes.

I got into this business because I'm a weirdo who loves probability and
statistics. Regardless of the political climate, Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning remain cool topics that are interesting to work on. A decade
later, this remains true. However the current state of discourse surrounding my
craft has dampened my love somewhat. It's unfortunate that this novel,
fascinating field has become the subject of intense financialization.
Nonetheless, I have ultimately benefited, so I cannot complain too much.

Beyond the above, I have very little to state for the time being. AI has been a
major love of my life, and also become my livelihood. I do not think that half
the statements surrounding AI are correct, either to the field's benefit or its
detriment. As with most fields, it is a nuanced subject. Feel free to email me
with any non-trivial questions
