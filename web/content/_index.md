# mesocycle.dev

Hi, my name's Axel Magnuson. I've worked in tech for most of my life (mostly
machine learning), and I dabble in video games and programming languages in my
spare time. This is my personal site and blog, where I write about anything that
crosses my mind.

If you want to chat, the best way to reach me is via email.

## Publications

- [Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14906)
  - TL;DR: you can improve content retrieval on existing LLMs by generating
    intermediate data during KV cache prefilling.
- [Evaluation of Topic Models for Content-Based Popularity Prediction on Social Microblogs](https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/td/1080/)
  - This was my Master's thesis. TL;DR: topic models are bad at predicting
    popularity (which is really unsurprising in retrospect), and I have the
    numbers to prove it.
