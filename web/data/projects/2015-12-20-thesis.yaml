description:
    "I completed my Masters thesis in December 2015 on methods for predicting 
    popular topics on Twitter.  Over the course of two years, I developed this 
    project from the early phase of exploratory research to a fully realized set
    of experiments which would evaluate cutting edge topic models such as
    Supervised LDA for their potential in extracting latent popular topics on
    Twitter, as well as clustering existing documents according to these topics.
    In addition to the body of research, I administered the BSU Infolab Hadoop 
    big data cluster for the duration of my degree (including an installation 
    from scratch).

    In this project, my primary tools were: *Pylab, Hadoop, Topic Models, 
    and Monte Carlo Methods*."
