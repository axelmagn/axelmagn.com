    "
    Black Sage Technologies builds security solutions that incorporate sensors
    such as cameras and ground radars to detect and classify moving objects.
    Since June 2015, I have helped Black Sage Tech build a flexible AI system
    that allows customers to train bespoke classifiers for site-specific
    security applications.  
    
    A fun aspect of this project was that it all had to be deployed onto both a
    field-ready NVIDIA Tegra platform and as a cloud web service.  This gave me
    the opportunity to wear the DevOps hat, and engineer a deployment process
    that could be standardized between a traditional cloud webapp platform and a
    hardware device.  
    
    In this project, my primary tools were: *Pylab, ExpressJS, BrainJS,
    Caffe, Lasagne, and Docker*."
